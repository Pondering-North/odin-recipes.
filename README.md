# odin-recipes.
The goal of this project is to build a basic recipe website. There will be no CSS, but
it will contain a main index page and links to a few recipes. 

Once I've completed it, I'll hopefully have learned how best to construct 
web pages, how to make links to other pages, the ways in which I can customize my
text (lists, headers, etc), and the best way to make said website secure.
