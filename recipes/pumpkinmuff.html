        <p>"Meet my favorite pumpkin muffin recipe, the sequel to my favorite zucchini muffins and banana muffins. 
            I appreciate “simple” muffin recipes like these because sometimes we don't crave all the bells and 
            whistles of pumpkin cream cheese muffins… right? Over-the-top muffins are undoubtedly delicious, 
            but I'm certain you'll want to make today's easy pumpkin muffins again and again."</p>
        <p>(Personal note - this is one of my favorite recipes.)</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 and 3/4 cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
            <li>1 and 1/2 teaspons ground cinnamon</li>
            <li>1 nd 1/2 teaspoons pumpkin pie spice</li>
            <l1>1/4 teaspoon ground ginger</l1>
            <l1>1/2 teaspoon salt</l1>
            <li>1/2 cup vegetable oil</li>
            <li>1/2 cup granulated sugar</li>
            <li>1/2 cup packed light or dark brown sugar</li>
            <li>1 and 1/2 cups canned pumpkin puree</li>
            <li>2 large eggs</li>
            <li>1/4 cup milk (dairy or nondairy)</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Directions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 425°F (218°C). Spray a 12-count muffin pan with nonstick 
                spray or line with cupcake liners.</li>
            <li>In a large bowl, whisk the flour, baking soda, cinnamon, pumpkin pie spice, ginger, 
                and salt together until combined. Set aside.</li>
            <li>In a medium bowl, whisk the oil, granulated sugar, brown sugar, pumpkin puree, eggs, 
                and milk together until combined. Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients, 
                and then fold everything together gently just until combined and no flour pockets remain.</li>
            <li>Spoon the batter into liners, filling them all the way to the top.</li>
            <li>Bake for 5 minutes at 425°F, then, keeping the muffins in the oven, reduce the oven temperature 
                to 350°F (177°C). Bake for an additional 16-17 minutes or until a toothpick inserted in 
                the center comes out clean. The total time these muffins take in the oven is about 
                21-22 minutes, give or take. Allow the muffins to cool for 5 minutes in the muffin pan 
                before enjoying.</li>
            <li>Cover tightly and store at room temperature for up to 1 week.</li>
